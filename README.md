Welcome to the week 1 repo akhileshkumarp_VSD_RISC-V_SOC_Tapeout_Program_week_1 as part of the VSD_RISC-V_SOC_Tapeout_Program.

The week 0 repo which has initial setup of ubuntu with yosys, iverilog and gtkwave can be found here : https://github.com/akhileshkumarp/akhileshkumarp_VSD_RISC-V_SOC_Tapeout_Program

This week_1 has 5 days of workshop with the following contents

Day_1 : Introduction to Verilog design and synthesis.
Day_2 : Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles.
Day_3 : Combinational and sequential optimizations.
Day_4 : GLS, blocking vs non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch.
Day_5 : Optimization in synthesis.

contents will be updated as things progress.
